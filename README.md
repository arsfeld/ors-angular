### Online Registration System for AIESEC written in AngularJS

This is a small project to create a new Online Registration System for AIESEC in
Brazil.

This project has a couple of objectives:
* Being able to completely replace the current system
* Remove unneeded features from the old system while integrating new ones
* Being stable (should always work!)
* Being open source, easy to hack and _easy to deploy_!
