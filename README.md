### Online Registration System for AIESEC written in AngularJS

This is a small project to create a new Online Registration System for AIESEC in
Brazil.

This project has a couple of objectives:
* Being able to completely replace the current system
* Remove unneeded features from the old system while integrating new ones
* Being stable (should always work!)
* Being open source, easy to hack and *easy to deploy*!

Also, the project is supposed to be a fun task for the summer, so I selected a 
few technologies to learn and use it in this project. 

The current technologies include:
* Nodejs (server)
* ExpressJS (backend)
* AngularJS (frontend)
* brunch (to put it all together)
* Jade (frontend templates)
* CoffeeScript
